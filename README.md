### Versions

This is the Fabric version of Bountiful.

Compared to the Forge version, the Fabric also includes:
* A reworked GUI interface
* A reworked rarity system
* A reputation system
* More balanced objectives and rewards
* Dual content loading from both datapacks and the config folder
* More flexible objective and reward definitions
* Commands to more easily add objectives/rewards to the game
* Boards generate with bounties already inside, in new villages
* Instanced bounties - everyone can take their own copy of a bounty off of the board.

The Forge version will be kept up to date, but will not get these additional features until 
I have time (and I'm quite busy!), or until someone would like to contribute a port.
